This is a *static front end* to a datase on Calabi-Yau arithmetic (CYCluster).

##### About the CYCluster

The focus of this database is to collect, store and process large datasets  on various arithmetic algebraic geometric, number theoretic and topological aspects of Calabi--Yau manifolds. 

##### Status

We are currently in the first stage of developing this database and a dynamical database is planned for alpha testing in the second quarter of 2025. If you would like to receive updates or volunteer to alpha-test, please reach out to us.

##### Contribute

In the mean time, we benefit greatly from input from the community regarding inclusion of datasets, features, functionalities. 

We are also looking to add valuable experience to this collaboration so if would like to volunteer in any of the following ways: 
- Doctesting and documentation
- Data generation
- Database security
- Stack development

**You can reach our team via email:** kidambi[AT]duck[dot]com 

We also have a dedicated sponsored [Zulip](https://cycluster.zulipchat.com) channel.
