	abstract = {We study a class of newly-introduced CFTs associated with even quadratic forms of general
signature, which we call generalized Narain theories. We first summarize the properties of
these theories. We then consider orbifolds of these theories, thereby obtaining a large class
of non-supersymmetric CFTs with exactly marginal deformations. We then discuss ensemble
averages of such theories over their moduli space, and obtain a modular form associated with
the quadratic form and an element of the discriminant group. The modular form can be
written as a Poincar{\'e} series, which contains novel invariants of lens spaces and suggests the
interpretation of the holographic bulk as a theory of anyons.},

@article{Kidambi:2022wvh,
	abstract = {The study of rational conformal field theories in the moduli space of conformal field theories is of particular interest since these theories correspond to points in moduli space where the
algebraic and arithmetic structure are usually richer, while also being points where non--trivial
physics occurs (such as in the study of attractor black holes and BPS states at rational points).
This has led to various attempts to characterize and classify such rational points. In this
paper, a conjectured characterization by Gukov--Vafa (Commun. Math. Phys. 246 (2004)
181) of rational conformal field theories whose target space is a Ricci flat Kaehler manifold
is analyzed carefully for the case of toroidal compactifications. We refine the conjectured
statement as well as making an effort to verify it, using T^4 compactification as a test case. Seven common properties in terms of Hodge theory (including complex multiplication) have been identified for T^4-target rational conformal field theories. By imposing a subset of the seven properties, however, there remain $$ \mathcal N = (1, 1) $$ SCFTs that are not rational. Open questions, implications and future lines of work are discussed.},

@article{LopesCardoso:2022hvc,
	abstract = {We use the exact degeneracy formula of single-centred 1/4 BPS dyonic black holes with unit torsion in $4D N=4$ toroidally compactified heterotic string theory to improve on the existing formulation of the corresponding quantum entropy function obtained using supersymmetric localization. The result takes the form of a sum over Euclidean backgrounds including orbifolds of the Euclidean $AdS_2\times S^2$ attractor geometry. Using an 
$N=2$ formalism, we determine the explicit form of the Abelian gauge potentials supporting these backgrounds. We further show how a rewriting of the degeneracy formula is amenable, at a semi-classical level, to a gravitational interpretation involving $2D$ Euclidean wormholes. This alternative picture is useful to elucidate different aspects of the gravitational path integral capturing the microstate degeneracies. We also comment on the relation between the associated 1D holographic models.},
